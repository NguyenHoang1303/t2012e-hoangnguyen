<h2><a name="Overview">Overview</a></h2><br>
<p>It is a long established fact that a reader will
    be distracted by the readable content of a page
    when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem
    Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters,
    as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.
    Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text,
    and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites
    still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years,
    sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

<h2><a name="IronMan"></a>IronMan</h2>
<p>
    Tony Stark. Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist. Son of legendary inventor and weapons contractor Howard Stark.
    When Tony Stark is assigned to give a weapons presentation to an Iraqi unit led by Lt. Col. James Rhodes, he's given a ride on enemy lines.
    That ride ends badly when Stark's Humvee that he's riding in is attacked by enemy combatants. He survives - barely - with a chest full of shrapnel and a car battery attached to his heart.
    In order to survive he comes up with a way to miniaturize the battery and figures out that the battery can power something else. Thus Iron Man is born.
    He uses the primitive device to escape from the cave in Iraq. Once back home, he then begins work on perfecting the Iron Man suit.
    But the man who was put in charge of Stark Industries has plans of his own to take over Tony's technology for other matters
</p>
<h2><a name="Thor">Thor</a></h2>
<p>The warrior Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is cast out of the fantastic realm of Asgard by his father Odin (Sir Anthony Hopkins) for his arrogance
    and sent to Earth to live amongst humans.
    Falling in love with scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) teaches Thor much-needed lessons, and his new-found strength
    comes into play as a villain from his homeland sends dark forces toward Earth.
